Installing the module
---------------------
The latest version of this module can be installed through Magento Connect. 

If you see any issue on the process or you have an old version, these are the manual instructions:
- unzip the .zip file
- copy over the app and lib trees
  - over ftp:
    - put -R app lib
    - ls app/code/local/EmPayTech/GetFinancing/Model/PaymentMethod.php
    - ls lib/EmPayTech/GetFinancing.php

Activating the module
---------------------
 - Go to the admin backoffice
 - At the top, go to System > Configuration
 - On the left, go to Sales > Payment Methods
 - If Getfinancing does not show up:
   - Flush the cache:
     - System > Cache Management
     - Click Flush Magento Cache
 - On the left, go to Sales > Payment Methods
 - Under GetFinancing:
   - Set Enabled to YES
   - Fill in Merchant ID
   - Fill in username
   - Fill in password

Opening the firewall
--------------------
Your server needs to be able to communicate with the GetFinancing platform.
We used to require merchants open ports 10000 and 10001 but since 2015 we allow to communicate 
with the standard 443 implied by https. If it works with the default url, you don't have to worry about this. 

Testing
-------

In the complete integration guide that you can download from our portal,
you can see various test personae that you can use for testing.

Switching to production
-----------------------

 - Go to the admin backoffice
 - At the top, go to System > Configuration
 - On the left, go to Sales > Payment Methods
 - Under 'GetFinancing', fill in the production URL, and switch the Platform
   dropdown from staging to production.

Note that after this change, you should no longer use the test personae you
used for testing, and all requests go to our production platform.

Module notes
------------
 - when checking out with GetFinancing, the quote only gets converted to
   an order after the loan has been preapproved.  This allows for easy
   rollback to other payment methods in case the loan is not preapproved.
 - the order is set to STATE_PAYMENT_REVIEW in Magento 1.4.1 and higher,
   and STATE_HOLDED before that.
 - Configure the postback url in the GetFinancing portal as
   getfinancing/standard/postback
   prefixed with your domain

Compatibility
-------------
 - This module has been tested with magento versions 1.4 through 1.9
