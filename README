Module notes
------------
 - when checking out with GetFinancing, the quote only gets converted to
   an order after the loan has been preapproved.  This allows for easy
   rollback to other payment methods in case the loan is not preapproved.
 - the order is set to STATE_PAYMENT_REVIEW in Magento 1.4.1 and higher,
   and STATE_HOLDED before that.
 - Configure the postback url in the GetFinancing portal as
   getfinancing/standard/postback
   prefixed with your domain

Compatibility
-------------
 - This module has been tested with magento versions 1.4 through 1.8
